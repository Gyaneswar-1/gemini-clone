> The overriding design goal for Markdown's
> formatting syntax is to make it as readable

> Markdown-formatted document should be
> publishable as-is, as plain text, without

> or formatting instructions.

This text you see here is *actually- written in Markdown! To get a feel
for Markdown's syntax, type some text into the left window and
watch the results in the right.

## Tech

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [ReactJS] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
- [vs code] - awesome text editor
- [vanila css] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
- [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend.

## Installation

Dillinger requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v10+ to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
cd google-gemini
npm i
```

For running app...

```sh
npm run dev
o + enter
```
